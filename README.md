# pythonProjects

This repository is simply the landing spot for the code I generate while learning python and producing some projects there after. I let myself get a little rusty coding wise and python seemed like a great language to brush up on my knowledge and skills with, more so because I want to use it on my RasPi. In addition to that I'll make sure all the skills and knowledge I acquired during school are freshened up and deepened. 

Once I finish with my learning materials I hope to work on a few projects, personal or otherwise to hone my abilities and demonstrate my skill as a programmer and maker.
